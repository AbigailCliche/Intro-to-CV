# Intro-to-CV
This repository contains work inspired by CS 6476 Introduction to Computer Vision. I completed this class online through Udacity. This course covered fundamentals of image formation, camera imaging geometry, feature detection and matching, multiview geometry including stereo, motion estimation and tracking, and classification.
